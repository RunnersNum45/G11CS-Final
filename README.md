# G11CS-Final

Code and files for my final project in grade 11 Comp-Sci at the Dragon Academy. 
I will be testing different machine learing techniques on recognizing handwritten numbers from the mnist database and testing the effectiveness of network arcitectures for image classification.

## MNIST
  The mnist folder contains files related to solving the mnist handwritten digits problem and the jupyter notebook explains the networks.
## Cat or Dog
  The Cats-vs-Dogs jupyter notebook explores several network structures and their accuracy and training time. The Classifier.py program trains and saves a fairly effective classifier.
